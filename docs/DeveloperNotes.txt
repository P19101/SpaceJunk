CLOCK SOURCES:
	There are 5 different possible sources for the clocks on the system. 
	The Clock Source information can be found starting in section 3 of the 
	family reference manual which starts on page 93.
	
	LFXTCLK(low frequency external clock) - Low-frequency oscillator which is connected to an external source
		which can be from a number of lower frequency sources such as crystals
		and digital pulses.
		
	VLOCLK(very low power clock) - Internal 10kHz clock source for lowest power consumption.
	
	DCOCLK(Digital Clock) - Digitally controlled internal clock with a selectable clock frequency
	
	MODCLK(modular low power clock) - 5MHz internal clock source which is a low power option, but obviously
		not as low power as the VLOCLK.
		
	HFXTCLK(high frequency external clock) - best performance, worst power. can support up to 24MHZ crystals

	There are three clock channels so to speak witch come from one of the five
	sources above. These are the MCLK(Master clock), SMCLK(Subsystem Master clock),
	and ACLK(Auxillary Clock). most peripherals can be run off any of these clocks,
	so they basically just mean that any 3 of the 5 options above can be operational
	at any point in time.
